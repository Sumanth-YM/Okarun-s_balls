# 🟡 Okarun's Ball
**A Hacknite Game Project by Brocoders**

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Okarun's Balls** is a fast-paced survival game set in a dual-realm universe where the player controls a golden ball — a 2D circle collider with dynamic physics interactions. The world is filled with deceptive allies and relentless foes.

## 🧠 Concept

At its core, the game is about **balance**, **timing**, and **unexpected twists**. While it may look simple, every bounce can be your last.

You must survive by navigating the golden ball across a dynamic field of obstacles and footholds. Sounds easy? Here's the catch.

## 🌌 Key Mechanics

### ☁️ Obstacles (Above)
- Positioned at the **top of the screen**
- **Hostile**: Always out to knock the player out
- Constantly change patterns and positioning

### 🌍 Footholds (Below)
- Located at the **bottom of the screen**
- Appear to be **helpful**, supporting the player
- But they can turn **deceptive** and **scarce** as the game progresses

### 🧱 Invisible Walls
- Not visibly present, yet their **impact is real**
- Colliding with them imparts **unique velocity changes** to the ball

## 🔥 The Lava Floor

> **Beware the LAVA FLOOR!**
